This repository represents work in C++ that I have done. 
Starting from the simpliest, these include: 
1)basicClasses
2)inheritance 
3)linkedList
4)binarySearch
5)sorting
6)huffmanCompression
7)systemCalls

I have also included the group project that I worked on with Shaoyi Han and Ashwin Dandekar called CheckersMaster which is a user versus computer game which incorporates varying degrees of difficulty with one difficult mode which is very had to beat.  It also includes some sounds and pictures which we acknowledge the use of in that project's README.
