Classwork 16, Problem 4
=======================

For this problem, you will implement a Set with a Binary Search Tree.
You should write a templated BstSet class in a file called bstset.h.
Your BstSet should implement the ADT found in set.h, and must use
a BST.  If you are clever, you can make use of the code that you wrote in p3
to do most of the work for this problem....

You should test this code yourself in a separate file.
