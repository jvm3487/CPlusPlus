Classwork 12, Problem 3
========================

In classwork 8, problem 3, you wrote a C program to read strings from input file(s),
sort them, and print them out.

In this problem, you will repeat that task (your program should behave exactly the same way),
however you will do it in C++, using the proper C++ tools.

 - You should use C++'s streams to read the input (opening std::ifstreams to read files, 
   or using std::cin to read from standard input).
 - You should use std::vector to hold the strings that you read in.
 - You should use std::sort to sort the vector
    [see http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/algorithm/sort/ for reference ]
 - You should then print the strings using std::cout.
